Hello World!

This is my GitHub home for CoffeeAndWings.com.  Well, that is what it will be when I am done with it. Hopefully.

I have a lot to learn: Jekyll. Javascripting. A bit of design work. And of course, I have to learn how to write so people will actually like to read my blog.  

That is a tall order. There are many like it. But this is MY Tall Order.
